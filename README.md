## Description
I created the Social Network project using JavaScript, MongoDB database "socialnetworkgglDB" and the Mongoose ODM, controllers to build the back end with three tables: User, Thought, and Reaction using Express.js API to interact with information stored in the database interfacing with Insomnia as the front end to share their thoughts and reactions to friends by creating, updating and deleting a friends list, creating users, thoughts and reactions.

A walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality will be added once the project is complete.
